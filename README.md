🥗 Recipe Finder – Project Description
Recipe Finder is a responsive web application  built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It offers an interactive interface where users can search for meals by ingredients or dish names, retrieve recipe suggestions from Spoonacular API, and explore full details—all without relying on frameworks.
 The app is ideal for minimizing food waste and making meal planning easy and efficient.

🔍 Features:
Ingredient-Based Search: Users can enter one or more ingredients (e.g., chicken, rice) to receive relevant recipes.

Live API Integration: Uses the Spoonacular API to fetch real-time recipe data.

Recipe Cards: Each recipe is displayed with an image, title, number of used/missing ingredients, and a "Save to Favorites" button.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Error Handling: Displays friendly messages when no recipes are found or if the API request fails.
